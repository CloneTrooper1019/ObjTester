This is a mini application I wrote to make it easier to grab obj/mtl/png files for meshes on roblox.
You can select from 3 methods:

*1: AssetId
*2: UserId 
*3: Username

Once you press the > button, a results menu will be shown. It shows you the 3D-Thumbnail Info URL, the Obj File URL, the MTL File URL, and the PNG file 
url(s)

To open the url, you can either double click on it, or select it and press the "Open Url" button.

Thats it basically.
